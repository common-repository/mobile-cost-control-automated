Validas uses MCCa for their consulting service: Mobile Cost Control (MCC).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
What does MCCa stand for?
Mobile Cost Control automated. It's brought to you by Validas, the same company that read millions of competitor bills for Sprint during their Cut Your Bill in Half campaign. 

What does MCCa do?
MCCa reads Verizon and AT&T bills in raw data format, estimates offers based on average savings, and generates leads. It utilizes 2 patents to automatically provide the following:
1. Read & format Verizon and AT&T business or government bills.
2. Instantly provide website visitors with accurate data from their bill and savings with your service.
3. Send customer data, billing data, and their uploaded bills to your websites' hosted databases.

What does MCCa format in the bill?
From 14 years of experience, we know how to read bills that are always changing formats, columns, column orders, and we haven't even mentioned the itemized charge formats and dating schemes! Our methods set up the bill in a table for your website's hosting to access from your backend to export into Excel for your own consumption.

What carriers bills can you read?
Verizon (Wireless) and AT&T, T-Mobile is coming soon.

What are you reading from the bill?
We read 2: 1) Device Report, 2) Bills in Raw Data format in a rdd zip file. Specifically, we read the files with itemized charges and credits per phone number.

How do users get bills in Raw Data Format?
These are downloaded from your online carrier account. If you don't have access to your company's carrier account. Speak with your company or agency's telecom or accounts payable team. 

What data from the bill do you show users? 
We instantly show users their bills: Total Cost, Total Line Count, Total Data Used, and Total Savings (your service offer). We are adding more categories and encourage you to request other totals you'd like to see! Email info@Validas.com

Can the data shown to users be hidden or changed?
1. The visibility of these data points are adjustable in the WordPress dashboard under the MCCa icon.
2. The methods and formulas behind these can be changed upon request, and we welcome requests from simple to complex. Email info@Validas.com

What data will you send to the website MCCa is uploaded to?
1. Hosting admin will see 2 tables to manage: 
A. Bills in a formatted table of bills per user.
B. Leads List: Users information and UI totals from the bill. 

2. WordPress admin will receive email notification of a bill uploaded along with user info, UI totals, and the bills uploaded. 

3. WordPress dashboard, MCCa icon will show a table of users that uploaded to your site, including data from their bill and links to their bills uploaded. 

How does MCCa create an offer for our services?
Savings is the "competitive offer" MCCa makes, and is controlled by you. Savings can also be a per line cost for your services. From your WordPress dashboard, simply enter your services average savings/ cost per line, and MCCa multiplies that by the number of lines we identify in our analysis.  Change “savings per line” in your WordPress dashboard to compete with or add value to mobile services.
Ex) Maybe you sell T-Mobile B2B and your service saves Verizon and AT&T customers $15/ line on average. All you need to do is change Savings per line to $15 in the WordPress dashboard so when a user uploads a Verizon bill on your website, MCCa will calculate the line count x $15 = Savings with our service.


Why is the billing data in the WordPress dashboard and the hosting table “NULL” under some users? 
That user entered their info, uploaded a bill, but they didn't press "Submit" to get more help. 

What happens if a user uploads a bill and no information is shown in their screen?
We will be notified of the issue and update. The user will have to upload their bill again to see the UI totals. Feel free to email us at info@Validas.com with any issues. 

Do you read personal bills for businesses with BYOD? 
No, MCCa reads bills that are for business and government accounts. Our other plugin: Wireless Butler reads PDF bills for individuals and advises the best plan for their carrier!

Is your analysis instant?
Yes, our patented analysis reads 2000 phone numbers per minute.

Can you read bills in raw data format from services other than mobile?
No but we know how to itemize bills for 14 years and are open to refactoring your ideas: info@Validas.com 

Will my company be sued because Sprint was sued for their Cut Your Bill in Half event?
No. Sprint was not sued for reading bills. Sprint was accused of using the word "half" incorrectly in their campaign.
